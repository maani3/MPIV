This is the Analysis Framework me and my colleagues have built. To use it please run it in a python virtual environment and a docker container. There is a lot of problems in dependencies hence we have used dummy modules and dummy packages to bypass import checks at compile time. 

The experimental results and graphs where not being uploaded here hence they are uploaded at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wLOyBl2WZalBfe4SiKznGAcMNx448yqR?usp=sharing
